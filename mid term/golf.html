              <p>Playing hard and playing together is at the heart<br>
                     of South Kent School’s athletic program. Our <br>
                     coaches emphasize integrity, intelligence, and i<br>
                     ntensity in team play. We believe in building strong,<br>
                      unified teams—win or lose.</p>

    <p>Our goal is to use athletics as a tool to prepare<br>
         young men for the challenges they will face throughout<br>
         their lives. Whether a student-athlete is competing at<br>
          the collegiate level or exploring a new sport for the<br>
           first time, there is a place for him in South Kent athletics.</p>
           <Pre>

    </Pre>
           <p>Every aspect of our program is designed to ensure that students<br>
             receive high-quality instruction and access to state-of-the-art<br>
              facilities. Practices, one-on-one coaching, and strength<br>
               training are all tailored to foster excellence—both on game<br>
                day and in life.</p>
                <Pre>

                <p>South Kent athletes are challenged daily and supported <br>
                    in their drive to improve. Our mission is to nurture <br>
                    the entire student body and to develop student-athletes<br>
                     of excellence.

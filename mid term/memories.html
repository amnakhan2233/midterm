        <p>“They will be remembered as we knew them in the full freshness and vigor of their young<br>
             manhood. And as the years roll on and the seasons come and go, each evening the school<br>
              will gather here for its few minutes of worship, prayer, and praise. And each morning<br>
               some will be here to celebrate the great sacrifice which carries with it the hope of<br>
                the world. Then in the words of an unknown poet­ –</p>
                <p><li>They shall not grow old</li></p>
                <p><li>As we that are left grow old.</li></p>
                <p><li>Age shall not weary them</li></p>
                <p><li>Nor the years condemn.</li></p>
                <p><li>At the going down of the sun</li></p>
                <p><li>We shall remember them.</li></p>
